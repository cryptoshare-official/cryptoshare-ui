        <p>We believe that CRYSHA does not necessarily need to be converted into a fiat currency to be used to purchase goods and services and based on this objective Crypto Share will make available means of acquiring products and services from our internal and external partners through the platform.</p>

        <h4>Internal Partners</h4>
        <p>All Crypto Share assets are real business in the real world, and its products and services will also be traded within the platform through the CRYSHA currency, this will give investors the opportunity to be their own customers and help the business prosper even faster.</p>

        <h4>External Partners</h4>
        <p>Products and services from other providers that make sense to our investors will also be traded on the platform through the CRYSHA currency.</p>
